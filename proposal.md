Ripple, A Mobile Environment Emulator
=====================================

Abstract
========

Ripple is a browser based mobile phone emulator to aid in the development
of HTML5 based mobile applications.  Ripple is a cross platform and cross
runtime based tool. It currently supports such runtimes as Cordova, WebWorks
and the Mobile Web.

Proposal
========

Background
==========

Ripple started as a product of tinyHippos who was later aquired by Research in Motion.  Ripple was then open sourced
under the Apache license and hosted on the blackberry github account. 

Ripple is a browser based mobile phone emulator that runs as a chrome extension.  It fills the gap for developers
needing to quickly edit-refresh-continue while working on web content that will be embedded and distributed as a native 
application.

Rationale
=========

The project is currently opensourced and managed by a small team at Research in Motion.  We are starting to have some
more community engagement but the project needs more.  Our team overlaps highly with the Cordova group and watching
the success for that project in Apache as inspired us to put ripple there as well.

Initial Goals
=============

Current Status
==============

Currently all development is managed on github via the issues and the direction of the project is strongly influenced by
Research in Motion.  A more clear project plan and more open communication will be needed by this project to abide by 
the apache guidelines.

Transition to Apache

Metriocracy

Core Developers

- Gord Tanner 
- Dan Silivestru
- Brent Lintner

Alignment
=========

Known Risks
===========

Orphaned Products
-----------------

Ripple is still core to the toolset at RIM and the Cordova / Phonegap community has embrased ripple into their tooling 
as well.

Inexperience with Open Source
-----------------------------

Homogenious Developers
----------------------

Reliance on Salaried Developers
-------------------------------

Relationships with Other Apache Products
----------------------------------------

There is a strong overlap and relationship between the ripple and cordova teams.  Gord is an active commiter in
both project and has been ensuring that both projects progress together.

An Excessive Fascination with the Apache Brand.
